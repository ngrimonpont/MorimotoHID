                        <h2>Returns / Exchanges / Cancellations</h2>
                        <p><span class="lead">How do I make a return or exchange?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Please login to the "My Account" page and use the "Requst a Return" link next to the order number that's associated with the product(s) you would like to return or exchange. We will issue you an RMA number within 24-48 hours. </span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">What is our return policy?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Due to the nature of our products, Morimoto does not accept returns on open-box HID bulbs or any items in our Closeouts section. Other parts may be returned if they are in like-new condition with their original unopened packaging. All returns must be made within 45 days and will be subject to a 20% restocking fee without exception. If the item(s) need any kind of reconditioning before they can be restocked, an additional 5% restocking fee will be applied. Please be advised that any free shipping promotions used on the original order will be forfeited if the order is returned and the original shipping costs (paid or unpaid) will also be deducted from the refundable amount. Due to the high volume of incoming and outgoing packages each day, if the provided RMA number is not clearly marked on the outside of the box it will be refused. The RMA number for this process is provided in the order screen of your Morimoto account page. Please allow two business days for your RMA request to be reviewed. We are not responsible for return postage unless the return is required due to our mistake, in which case we will send a pre-paid shipping label. We cannot store returned items for more than 45 days, so if no action is taken within that time-frame; your items will be relinquished.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">What is our exchange policy?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Parts may be exchanged if they are in like-new condition with their original unopened packaging for credit towards anything else in-stock. Please note: no products from our "Closeouts" section can be exchanged. Exchanges must be made within 60 days of the original purchase date. For example, you ordered projector "X" but changed your mind and now want to use projector "Y". If your returned part(s) cannot be restocked as "new" we reserve to right to deny the exchange or apply only a partial credit towards your new items (no more than 20% reduction in value.) If you need to make a rushed exchange, you can order the new part first and then return the original for a refund without being subject to any restocking fees on the “exchanged” item.  The RMA number for this process is provided in the order screen of your Morimoto account page. Please allow two business days for your RMA request to be reviewed. </span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">What is our refund policy?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">If you return an item for a refund, it must first meet the criteria stated in our above returns policy. All returns must be received at Morimoto within 45 days from their original purchase date. All refunds must be issued back to the original payment source. After 45 days from the original purchase date but within 90 days, we can submit refunds only by store credit or check. After 90 days, we can only provide refunds as store credit. If an order is placed using store credit; and that order requires a refund, the store credit will be re-applied to your account. This policy shall apply to any product purchases or deposits. The RMA number for this process is provided in the order screen of your Morimoto account page. </span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">How are shipping costs handled on returns/exchanges?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">The customer is responsible for shipping costs to and from our shop. However, if the exchange is necessary because of our mistake, we will cover all shipping charges involved. Free shipping coupons are not valid on any exchange. If you used a free shipping promotion on your original order and returned that order for a refund or exchange; that promotion is then forfeited and the actual shipping costs will be deducted from the refund/store credit granted.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">How can I cancel or change my order before it ships?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">You must call us before the order status is changed to "complete." Once the order status is marked as complete, the products have already left our warehouse. Please beware that due to our e-mail volume, we can only guarantee cancellation requests will be fulfilled if they are called in before 1:00pm EST. Once an order has left the building, shipping costs are non-refundable. Special Orders cannot be cancelled; they are placed based your commitment to the purchase.</span></p>

                        <h2>Warranties</h2>
                        <p><span class="lead">What is the warranty on my parts?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Please refer to the products listing page for specific warranty information, as it varies depending on the brand, configuration, etc. All warranties are non-transferrable and are only applicable to the original purchaser.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">How can I get a replacement for something that failed?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Please troubleshoot by switching components from side to side to isolate the problem. Once we have clearly identified which component failed; you will not have to return it to us for a replacement. You will be asked to send in an image with the wires on the part cut and the serial number visible. A new part will be issued, generally within 1-3 business days. We will replace dead bulbs alone if the purchase was one year or less from the time of failure. If the bulbs are still under warranty and it has been more than two years, we will replace the pair. In special cases, we won't require you to permanently disable the part before a replacement is sent (ie if a light bulb is mis-colored but still working). OEM Parts must be returned for warranty service. Morimoto brand parts can be warrantied without return. If an item is discontinued by the manufacture; it's warranty is not void, but the part will be replaced with the current equivalent of the same product. No refunds or credit will be issued in lieu of replacements. </span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">What if my part is still partially working, do I still have to disable it first to be eligible for replacement?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">In this case, we can collect a refundable deposit on a brand new replacement part, and then refund you for that deposit once the warranty image criteria is fulfilled. Please note that to be eligible for a refund on your deposit; the part must be replaced and your warranty image(s) must be sent in no later than 60 days from the date that the refundable deposit was placed. </span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">How are warranty replacements shipped?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Shipments of replacement parts will be made by USPS First Class Mail and will be paid for by Morimoto. If you are outside of the US, you will be required to pay only the shipping costs involved to deliver your replacement part. If you are a customer of one of our distributors, we are not responsible for any shipping costs to delivery the warranty replacement. In either case, there is no charge for the replacement part itself. If the customer desires any other shipping method (ie overnight) then they will be responsible for the associated costs above and beyond our standard warranty shipping method.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">What if something is missing from my order?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">If you believe that an item is missing from your order; please help by sending us a picture of your order contents, the packing slip, and the packaging it arrived in. We will work together with you to help make sure you receive the correct/missing parts right away. Any missing or damaged-in-transit parts must be reported within 30 days of delivery. Beyond that - we will not be responsible for such parts or any associated costs to deliver them.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">I opted for Assembly Service on my Morimoto housings. What's covered under warranty?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">The housings will be completely assembled at our facility and the lens dunk-tested to ensure that no moisture can enter the housings. The coverage guarantees the installation of the shroud and projector, the moisture-resistance of the housings under normal conditions, and the proper alignment of the projector within the housing. The warranty does not cover normal wear and tear from everyday driving or environmental damage, abuse, or extreme off-roading (including complete submergence of the housings). If LED halos are added, any failures are covered by replacement parts as specified by that products normal warranty, but a $50 fee will apply for the associated labor to re-open, replace, and re-seal the housing to replace one.</span></p>

                        <h2>Shipping</h2>
                        <p><span class="lead">Does Morimoto offer shipping outside the US?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Yes, we ship to every country worldwide. For a shipping quote, please create an account and proceed through the checkout process on our website. Before you submit an order or provide any billing information, the website will display shipping options. We have many customers all over the world from Canada, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UK, Asia, and Australia. All import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees are to be paid by the recipient. Such fees are not included in the shipping or product cost paid to Morimoto. Falsifying customs documents with artifically low declared or "gift" values is against the law and we will will not do it. </span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">What shipping options are available, how long will delivery take?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">We offer shipping by UPS, DHL, and the US Postal Service. UPS offers guaranteed transit times for their overnight and expedited services. USPS offers estimated transit times for their Express and Priority mail services, but no guaranteed delivery dates. We take zero liability for delayed delivery on all USPS shipments regardless of the so-called "guaranteed" delivery dates that show when tracking a package online and cannot apply for postage refunds. Once a package leaves our shop, the transit time is completely out of our control. Please beware that with USPS priority, parcel post, or first class shipments; the delivery time can vary all the way from two to sometimes thirty or more days depending on your location. Shipping costs are paid to the carrier are are non-refundable under any circumstance. These policies apply for all domestic and international shipments.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">Where do the parts ship from?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">All items are shipped from our facility in Atlanta, GA. Orders generally ship within 24-72 hours. Our cutoff time for same day shipping is 1pm EST. If you call in an order with overnight shipping (UPS only) we will extend our shipping cutoff time to 4pm EST.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">My Package is lost, what can we do?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">If you do not receive your package and the tracking information shows that the package has been delivered you must notify us within twenty-one days of the marked delivery date so that we can initiate a lost package tracer with the shipping carrier you have originally selected. Replacement products will not be sent until the shipping carrier completes the tracer request and grants permission for replacement product to be shipped. UPS typically requires up to eight business days from the time the claim is started. USPS can require from five to ninety business days, and this may vary depending on your country/destination. Please note that this is the policy of the shipping carriers and not of Morimoto. Morimoto does not guarantee that any packages will be credited by the shipping carrier until this process is complete. Unless you selected the insurance option at checkout, refunds and/or replacements will not be given unless the carrier approves your lost package claim.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="lead">I want my shipment insured, what are my options?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">UPS shipments are automatically insured for $100 within the Domestic US. USPS shipments do not have any insurance by default. If you would like your package insured for its full value, you must add shipping insurance on the shipping option screen during checkout. With insurance, you will be covered against damage, loss, or any delivery related issues. If no insurance is added and you selected UPS shipping, you will only be covered for $100. If no insurance is added and you selected USPS shipping, unfortunately we won't be able to guarantee any kind of resolution. Packages will be insured by Morimoto to handle claims directly, so if you’re insured there is no waiting period for resolution.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">I got an email saying my order was “shipped” but my tracking number hasn’t updated, what do I do?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">The USPS tracking number system is not very accurate, so even if an item has been shipped, their system may not recognize the tracking information immediately. UPS tracking information should show an update the night it was picked up. When shipping volume is high, sometimes the carriers don’t update their tracking right away – feel free to check with us if you’re unsure and we can confirm if the package is in the carriers hands.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">My tracking number says "delivered" but I do not have my item, what can I do?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Please contact the carrier with any questions about delivery problems. All shipping labels are generated electronically according to the address information given with your order. We are not liable for lost or stolen items unless shipping insurance was added. We will gladly assist our customer if there is a problem in any way we can though.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">When taking advnatage of a free shipping promotion, Can I to choose what service is used?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">No, Morimoto reserves the right to default to any different shipping method if your order used a promo for free shipping. Free shipping offers/coupons are not applicable to any customers outside of the US nor to any orders lower than $30 in value. If you must have an order shipped using a specific carrier/method, then no shipping coupons should be applied.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">What is a Retrofit</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Power is nothing without control. Retrofitting is the process of installing a xenon or bi-xenon projector into a reflector based halogen headlight. It is the best HID headlight upgrade possible since the projector will control the light into a properly dispersed, non-glaring beam pattern.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">What kits are compatible with my car?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Because of the wide variety of products we sell, there may be just one or a few different options for each application. We do not list what fits what for this reason. If you are unsure what will work best for you, please contact us for a personalized recommendation. Our buyers guide is also a great tool to use for reference.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">Does Morimoto offer retrofitting services?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Please visit our Dealers page to find an installer. We can aid in coordinating a turn-key retrofit for you with one of our professional retrofitting affiliates. Morimoto concentrates on the development and supply of parts, but does not offer retrofitting services in house.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="lead">Where can I find installation instructions?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">Each product has its own PDF available for download on their corresponding page. If you're having trouble with an installation, please contact us or a professional for help before continuing.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="lead">How do I open a wholesale account with Morimoto?</span></br>
                        <span class="small">We offer wholesale pricing on two different tiers for resellers and installers. We also offer drop-shipping services for companies who don't wish to carry an inventory of our parts. Please submit an account application, and we will get back to you within 1-3 business days to let you know the status of your application, or simply contact us for more information. Wholesale accounts are reserved for legitimate businesses who can provide tax ID information and do require a $500 minimum first order.</span></p>
